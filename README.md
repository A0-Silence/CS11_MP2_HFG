# CS11_MP2_HFG
A (currently nameless) game being developed as a school project, which involves monsters and food.

If you're one of my groupmates (or if you're me), the initial version was based off of main.py in Monsters + Fighting.zip
The only difference between that and this is that I split main.py into 5 different modules so it's easier to look at 
  and easier to find things related to one concept.
